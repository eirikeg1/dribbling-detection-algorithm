# Dribbling Detection Algorithm

A Rust-based implementation for detecting dribbling events on the [SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction 2024](https://www.soccer-net.org/) dataset. The goal behind this tool is not to get the most accurate predictions,but to get a set of good candidates which can be manually approved to not approved later. Therefore this is not indended to be used for classification, but to build a dataset quickly.

## Dataset

* This tool is designed for the SoccerNet GSR 2024 dataset.
* A simple way to download the data is through the official [Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoccerNet/SN-GSR-2025).
* The official challenge repository, with other instructions of how to download the data can be found at [sn-gamestate](https://github.com/SoccerNet/sn-gamestate)
* Refer to the official [SoccerNet website](https://www.soccer-net.org/) for more information about soccernet and their challenges/datasets

# Setup
The setup is described for ubuntu based systems

## Configurations
Adjust paths, parallelism, and other runtime parameters in ```config.toml```.

## Requirements

- **Rust** (latest stable recommended)
- **OpenCV** (3.4 or 4.x)  
  Ensure OpenCV and its development headers are installed on your system. If automatic detection fails, the projectâ€™s `build.rs` ensures correct linking of OpenCV (including `stdc++`).
- **OpenSSL**
   Is a dependency of the reqwest library, used for downloading dataset

## Installation

1. **Install Rust**:  
   Follow the official [Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to set up Rust and Cargo.

2. **Install OpenCV**:  
   Ensure OpenCV (3.4 or 4.x) is installed. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev pkg-config cmake
   ```
3. **Install openssl**
   * Debian and ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev
   ```
   * [Other](https://docs.rs/openssl/latest/openssl/)
4. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dribbling-detection-algorithm.git
    cd dribbling-detection-algorithm
    ```
    At this point, the project should be ready to build and run.


## Building & Running
   To download data: (Not working yet, download as described above for now)
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --download
   ```


To run the algorithm:
```bash
cargo run
```

# Algorithm Description

This algorithm is designed to quickly identify clips that are more likely to contain dribbling actions from the 2025 SoccerNet Game-State Recognition Challenge dataset. It is not intended to be fully accurate but aims to facilitate efficient dataset creation, by outputting a large set of possible clips which quite likely might contain a drible. It is based on the players 2d coordinate on the field (after a homographic transform)

## Conceptual Overview
1. **Possession Identification**
   - Tag the player closest to the ball as the possession holder.
   - Use proximity-based possession determination.
   - Consider integrating player velocity to improve possession tracking.
   - Adjust proximity range dynamically if many players are nearby.

2. **Proximity Zones**
   - **Outer Radius (outer_rad)**: Defines a larger interaction zone.
   - **Inner Radius (inner_rad)**: Defines a smaller, closer interaction zone.
   - This two-zone approach creates a "spatial interaction" framework for detecting events like tackles or dribbles.

3. **Event Detections**
   - **Dribble**: When the possession holder retains the ball after defensive pressure for a set period.
   - **Tackle**: When an opponent takes possession from the original possession holder.

## Algorithm Flow
**(Currently focused on dribbling detection, not tackling detection)**

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Define `outer_rad` (player radius) and `inner_rad` (ball radius). 
   - Consider homography to estimate distances.
   - Create a `DribbleEvent` structure to store:
     - Possession holder (player ID)
     - Start and end frames
     - List of frame numbers
     - List of active defenders (player IDs)

2. **State Transitions**
   - **Search State**: 
     1. Identify closest player to the ball.
     2. Check if the ball is within the player's `inner_rad`.
     3. Check for defenders within `inner_rad` or `outer_rad`.
     4. If defenders are found, transition to **Start Track State**.

   - **Start Track State**: 
     1. Record start frame.
     2. Add defenders within range to `active defenders`.
     3. Create a `DribbleEvent` and move to **Track State 1**.

   - **Track State 1 (Close Proximity to Defender)**: 
     1. Add the current frame to the dribble event's frame list.
     2. Add closest defender to active defenders.
     3. If possession changes or the ball is too far from the player, cancel the event and return to **Search State**.
     4. If any opponent enters `inner_rad`, transition to **Track State 2**.

   - **Track State 2 (Duel)**: 
     1. Freeze ball possession updates.
     2. Stay in this state until only one player remains within `inner_rad`.
     3. Transition to **Detection State**.

   - **Detection State**: 
     1. Identify possession holder.
     2. If original possession holder still has possession, start a timer or frame counter.
        - If possession is maintained for a set duration, a **Dribble** is detected.
     3. If an opponent listed as an active defender gains possession, a **Tackle** is detected.
     4. Save detections, if any, and return to **Search State**.

This logic aims to highlight potential dribbling clips, enabling faster dataset curation for training more robust dribbling detection models.
